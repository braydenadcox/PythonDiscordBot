# Leetcode Python Discord Bot Source Code
This is a Discord bot written in Python using the discord.py library to create a bot that can help answer Leetcode problems. The Leetcode API has been slightly integrated into the code, but the LLM had not been implemented yet. That will happen shortly, probably within a week as of 1-10-2025, so stay tuned for more pushes.

## .env Example
```txt
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your token here"
```

## Getting Started

First, make sure you create a .env file to hold your tokens, this file will be ignored if you clone this branch. Put the .env example code above into here, and paste your personal bot token. You should be able to do this with your discord bot by creating one in the developer portal for free, and adding it to a functionable discord server you have permissions over.

## Installing Dependencies

To do this, run this code in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run:

```bash
python bot.py
```
